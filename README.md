# Udacity FEND Neighborhood Map Project

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 

Included is a list of my' favorite restaurants and Cafe around Panorama Mall , Riyadh

# How To Use

1. Open index.html to run the web application
2. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information
3. Type in the white bar if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot.
